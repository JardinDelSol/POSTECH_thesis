A Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) is a type of stochastic process, where its realization is a set of event-time data. 
MTPP is often used to analyze complex dynamics of discrete temporal events such as money transaction, social media, healthcare, etc. 
Recent studies have incorporated various deep neural networks to capture complex dependencies between events and generate embeddings that effectively represent the observed events. 
While most of existing research focuses on modeling inter-event dependencies and their representations, the influence of individual events on the overall temporal dynamics has received less attention.
To address this gap, we introduce a Decoupled MTPP framework that separates the characterization of the stochastic process into a series of 
evolving influences from individual events. 
Our method uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn the continuous dynamics of these influences flexibly, 
while simultaneously solving multiple inference tasks.
We demonstrate the importance of disentangling these influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art techniques on real-world datasets.
We also provide analysis of the model's behavior, highlighting its potential applications.
