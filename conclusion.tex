In this work, we presented a novel framework for modeling MTPP, i.e., Dec-ODE,  
that decouples influence from each event for flexibility and computational efficiency. 
The Dec-ODE leverages neural ODE to model continuously changing behavior of influence from individual events, 
which govern the overall behavior of MTPP, and we proposed a training scheme 
for a linear Dec-ODE, which let the influences be efficiently computed in parallel. 
The proposed method was validated on five real-world benchmarks yielding 
comparable or superior results. 
Moreover, it provides explainability to the modeling,
which suggests significant potential for applications such as out-of-distribution detection and survival analysis.
