In this work, we introduced a novel framework for modeling MTPPs, referred to as Dec-ODE, which decouples the influence of each event to enhance flexibility and computational efficiency. The Dec-ODE utilizes neural ODEs to model the continuously evolving influence of individual events, which control the overall dynamics of the MTPP. Additionally, we proposed a training scheme for a linear Dec-ODE, enabling the efficient parallel computation of influences. The method was validated on five real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable or superior performance. Furthermore, it offers explainability in the modeling process, highlighting its potential for applications in areas such as out-of-distribution detection and survival analysis.
